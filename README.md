# demo-rapier-three

This repo provides a working example of rendering using [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and
physics simulation using [rapier3d](https://rapier.rs/).

This package also demonstrates how to organize a non-trivial three.js project with a bundler.
Many three.js examples consists of a single HTML file with script tags, which is not a great
starting point for someone interested in writing a serious game or application. This repo
demonstrates how to integrate with several popular JavaScript tools and libraries:

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)

In general, the code strives to conform to industry standard practices for commercial JavaScript
application development.
